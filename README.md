Hello world!

I'm Chris Manning, a localization expert fascinated with coding, languages and machine learning. Those things may not seem to have too much in common, but applied together, can bring our world much closer together. My goal is to create tools that simplify l10n, making it far faster to go from source code to translation into any number of languages using workflow, integrated teams and machine learning tools.

I hope you'll find value in what I contribute. I'm not much of a coder yet, but that's not going to stop me.
